# Setup and Execution
Download program and run in terminal. 
The graph representing the nodes and weighted edges is predefined.
When prompted, input a source node (start destination) as a capital letter. Valid nodes include A-W.
After inputting a source node, this returns the shortest path and total cost to the 4 charging station locations set in the array.
Charging station node locations: H, K, Q, T.
